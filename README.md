# Twitter-following-project
In this project we were given a comma separated file to represent some twitter users and the users they follow. The file name is “twitter.csv”. Each row represents a certain user’s id and the id of another user he/she follows.

Also we suggest new accounts for the user to follow based on the people they already follow.
